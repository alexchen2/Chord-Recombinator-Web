# Chord-Recombinator-Web
A WIP port of kchenforyou's Music Chord Recombinator project as a web application.

A prototype of website can be found [here](https://chordguru.glitch.me) (may be outdated with current version in this repo).

## To-do:
- ~~Create design and add implementation of interactive staff/text field input~~
- Hook up sound to results page in chord info row dropdown
- Add proper home page (instead of redirecting to chord subpage) -- unlikely to accomplish

## Credits:
